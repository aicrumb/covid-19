# Estimating conception times of SARS-COV-2 cases

Based on: [A video by CaryKH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnQcbAKWkPE)

Loosely,

Given the confirmed cases, for every day I take the number of cases, make a gaussian distribution of that size spanning from 2-16 days (the incubation period), and I stack them to create the real rate of new Covid-19 cases.
