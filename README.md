# Estimating the Real amount of Covid-19 Cases using the Current Confirmed Cases

Based on: [A video by CaryKH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnQcbAKWkPE)

Loosely,

Given the confirmed cases, for every day I take the number of cases, make a gaussian distribution of that size spanning from 2-16 days (the incubation period), and I stack them to create the real rate of new Covid-19 cases.

(a graph from Thomas Pueyo that explains what I want to show, for EVERY country)



#### My Graphs:

I found the current rate of growth to be 0.9884451230091259/day in the US (as of whenever my data ends),

If that exponential growth were to hold steady for whatever reason, in one month we'll have close to 900740 new cases
Or if the Government lossens restrictions the rate could go over 1, and the number of cases will sky-rocket again
Oh wow what's happening
Do I hear loosening restrictions already
dang
