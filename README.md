# Estimating the Real amount of Covid-19 Cases using the Current Confirmed Cases

Based on: [A video by CaryKH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnQcbAKWkPE)

Loosely,

Given the confirmed cases, for every day I take the number of cases, make a gaussian distribution of that size spanning from 2-16 days (the incubation period), and I stack them to create the real rate of new Covid-19 cases.

(a graph from Thomas Pueyo that explains what I want to show, for EVERY country)



#### My Graphs:

I found the current rate of growth to be 0.9884451230091259/day in the US,

If the rate were to hold steady for whatever reason, in one month we'll have over 900737 new cases
